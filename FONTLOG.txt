FONTLOG for the Gyrochrome font

Overview

Gyrochrome is a rounded, geometric sans-serif derived from Vernon
Adams' Michroma (https://github.com/vernnobile/Michroma-font).

Specifically, it is derived from the Google Fonts version 1.100
(https://github.com/googlefonts/Michroma-font) released on May 25,
2023 by Emma Marichal. While that version, unlike Adams' original,
does not identify "Michroma" as a Reserved Font Name, this derived
font is different enough from the original (not only in style, but in
the design and composition of some characters) that it seemed more in
the spirit of the OFL to give it a new name and make it clear that any
quality issues with the font should be laid at my door, not theirs.
For a from-scratch take on the same genre, see Gyrotrope
(https://github.com/dmoles/gyrotrope-font).

This font exists because I needed a font "of the rounded-square sans
genre that is closely associated with a 1960s feeling of the future"
(as Adams described the original Michroma), in the tradition of
Eurostile and Microgramma, for a design project, but in a rounded
style; I had no budget; and I had a Glyphs 3 license. If you find it
useful, I'm happy, but if you can afford a real typographer you should
definitely hire one.
